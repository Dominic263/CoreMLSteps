# CoreMLSteps
This repository contains a documentation of the resources I am gathering while learning Apple's CoreML Framework. The framework helps developers to design applications which have A.I & machine learning capabilities to solve real world problems. The starter module contains resources learnt while learning Natural Language Processing and preceding modules will focus on Vision Framework for analysing images. 

The documentation is located in the Wiki page
