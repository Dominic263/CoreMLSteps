# CoreMLSteps
This repository contains a documentation of the resources I am learning while learning Apple's CoreML Framework. This will help me develop applications that apply machine learning to solve real world challenges. The starter module contains resources learnt while learning Natural Language Processing and preceding modules will focus on Vision Framework for analysing images. 

The documentation is located in the Wiki page
